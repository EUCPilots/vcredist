### Visual C++ Redistributables

The Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables are a core component of any Windows desktop deployment. Because multiple versions are often deployed they need to be imported into your deployment solution or installed locally, which can be time consuming. The aim of this module is to provide a definitive list of available Redistributables and functions for managing deployment of those Redistributables across various mechanisms.
