# Install-VcRedist

## SYNOPSIS
Installs the Visual C++ Redistributables on the local system.

## SYNTAX

```
Install-VcRedist [-VcList] <PSObject> [-Path <String>] [-Silent] [-Force] [-ProgressAction <ActionPreference>]
 [-WhatIf] [-Confirm] [<CommonParameters>]
```

## DESCRIPTION
Installs the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributables from a list created by Get-VcList and downloaded into a folder structure locally with Save-VcRedist.
Supports both passive and silent installation of the Redistributables.
Useful for Windows deployments including creating gold images via HashiCorp Packer where the Redistributables can be downloaded and installed at runtime.
Installers whose manifest SupportedArchitecture list does not include the native Windows architecture are skipped with a warning, even when using -Force.
Each input object must include a non-empty SupportedArchitecture list.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```
$VcRedists = Get-VcList -Release 2013, 2019 -Architecture x64
Install-VcRedist -VcList $VcRedists -Path C:\Temp\VcRedists
```

Description: Installs the 2013 and 2019 64-bit Visual C++ Redistributables listed in $VcRedists and downloaded to C:\Temp\VcRedists.

### EXAMPLE 2
```
$VcRedists = Get-VcList -Release "2012","2013","2017" -Architecture x64
Install-VcRedist -VcList $VcRedists -Path C:\Temp\VcRedists
```

Description: Installs only the 64-bit 2012, 2013 and 2017 Visual C++ Redistributables listed in $VcRedists and downloaded to C:\Temp\VcRedists.

### EXAMPLE 3
```
$VcRedists = Get-VcList -Release "2012","2013","2017" -Architecture x64 | Save-VcRedist -Path C:\Temp\VcRedists
Install-VcRedist -VcList $VcRedists -Silent
```

Description: Installs all supported Visual C++ Redistributables using a completely silent install.
